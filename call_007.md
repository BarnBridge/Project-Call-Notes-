## Intro

**Troy:** BarnBridge call 007, James Bond would be very happy. It's fitting that this is the last call of the year. Let's jump right into it.

# Tech/Dev
## BarnBridge App

**Dragos:** Last week, as promised, we released a new version. Everything has been running smoothly so far– minus a small issue pointed out by the community regarding a UX flaw. It's a minor flaw happening with the withdraw. We will fix that. Thank you to the person who notified us. Other than that, there are not too many new updates. We will roll out more updates, but they are more to do with the BBDAO and our products.

Alright, Bogdan, take it away, and give the saucy details!

### BBDAO

**Bogdan:** Since last time, we have updated the smart contracts. We've added more functionality. For example, you can cancel a proposal in-case something is wrong or found like a bug or something similar. We went forward with internal reviews– they are complete. Nothing major was wrong, just a few small fixes. Kudos to Atpar for finding and fixing them.

We kicked off one of the audits. It's ongoing. The second one will start up before the first one finishes, so there will be some overlap.

The back-end is in progress. Not much excitement there. We are on the final stretch with a working data pipeline. I think that's all that's remaining– pulling data for the proposals.

Front-end, I'd say 75-80% done. They are connected to the smart contracts deployed on the test-net, & they are connected to the back-end. We just have the proposal creation. Just polishing the final test and checks.

### Smart Yield BOND

**Bogdan:** Smart contracts development is in progress and running smoothly. We are going to have the first version of them working, hopefully by the end of this week. The internal reviews on those will occur soon.

UI design is close to being completed, just some finishing touches left. We have done a walkthrough with some of the team and some of the investors. Everybody seems to be happy with the appearance. External audits– booked. Once the internal reviews are finished, we will open the repos to the auditors. The audits are booked for February, so we are on track for the March launch.

Regarding the back-end specs, there is also not much to update— not a very exciting part. 

### Smart Alpha BOND

**Bogdan:** 

## DeFi Standards
## Bounties
## Operations/Marketing Run down
