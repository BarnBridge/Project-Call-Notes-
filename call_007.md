## Intro

**Troy:** BarnBridge call 007, James Bond would be very happy. It's fitting that this is the last call of the year. Let's jump right into it.

# Tech/Dev
## BarnBridge App

**Dragos:** Last week, as promised, we released a new version. Everything has been running smoothly so farâ€“ minus a small issue pointed out by the community regarding a UX flaw. It's a minor flaw happening with the withdraw. We will fix that. Thank you to the person who notified us. Other than that, there are not too many new updates. We will roll out more updates, but they are more to do with the BBDAO and our products.

Alright, Bogdan, take it away, and give the saucy details!

### BBDAO

### Smart Yield BOND
### Smart Alpha BOND
## DeFi Standards
## Bounties
